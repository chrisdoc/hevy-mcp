### Patch Changes

- [#833](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/833) [`39d5896`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/39d589617b1a83ae36a97ce6b52aa89f022681e5) Thanks [@neontty](https://github.com/neontty)! - Fix get-routine failing for every routine: the Routine read schema typed each exercise's `rest_seconds` as a string, but the Hevy API returns an integer. Correct the OpenAPI spec (and regenerated client) to type it as an integer and align the get-routine output contract, matching the Post/Put routine request schemas. get-routines was unaffected because its compact projection omits `rest_seconds`.
