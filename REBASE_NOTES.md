# Rebase and Integration Test Improvements

## Summary
This documents the successful rebase of the `replace-kiota-with-kubb` branch onto the latest main branch and improvements to integration test behavior.

## Changes Made

### Rebase Work
- Successfully rebased `replace-kiota-with-kubb` branch onto latest main (commit 4124020)
- Resolved merge conflicts in `package.json` (removed Kiota dependencies)
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` to resolve conflicts
- Skipped redundant "chore: update package-lock.json" commit during rebase
- Force-pushed rebased branch to update PR #49

### Integration Test Improvements
- Initially modified integration test to skip gracefully when HEVY_API_KEY is missing
- Reverted to original behavior that provides informative error with setup instructions
- This ensures users get clear guidance on how to set up the API key for testing

### Verification
- All unit tests pass (25/26 tests, 1 integration test appropriately fails without API key)
- Build succeeds without errors
- Code quality checks pass
- Kubb client generation works correctly (129 files generated)

## Status
- Branch: `replace-kiota-with-kubb` 
- PR: #49 (updated with rebased changes)
- Integration test behavior: Correctly informs users about missing HEVY_API_KEY
- All dependencies properly resolved after rebase
